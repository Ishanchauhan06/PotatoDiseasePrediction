# Potato Disease Prediction
## Description
Potato Disease Prediction is a project aimed at predicting whether a potato plant is affected by late blight or early blight diseases. By accurately identifying the disease, appropriate measures can be taken to treat the plant with suitable medicines, thus preventing crop loss. This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and TensorFlow framework to achieve disease prediction.
